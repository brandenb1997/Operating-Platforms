# Operating-Platforms

The Gaming Room needed software developed for their game Draw It or Lost It. This game is a multiplayer web-based game consisting of multiple players and teams.

In the development of this document, I made sure to hit each point that the client needed to ensure that their needs were met. In construction of the document, I made sure to have it easily readible in order to make it easy to understand and help with a seamless reference when developing the code.

Working with the design document helps compartmentalize each aspect in order for the program to run smoothly. The document helped map out which parts needed the most attention/focus in order to help the other elements complete their tasks.

If I was to revise any part of the document, I would revise the Evaluation section. When completing this section, I believe I did a great job of showing the pros and cons of each platform, but I lacked in showing how these pros and cons specifically effected the Draw It or Lose It game specifically.

When implementing the user's needs into the design and construction of the whole project, it needs a lot of focus to not only ensure that the needs are met, but to properly bring to life what they had envisioned. When it came to implementing them into the coding aspect of the project, different needs call for specific functions, classes, etc.

In the future, I would continue to use design documents upon creating software. The design documents help put the ideas in the air down on paper that can later be transferred and created in the code.
